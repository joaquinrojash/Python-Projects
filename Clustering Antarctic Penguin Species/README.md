# Penguins EDA & ML

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling using the popular Palmer Penguins dataset. The objective is to explore the relationships between different penguin features and build predictive models using clean and visualized data.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `penguins-eda-ml.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with EDA, visualizations, and model building.
- `penguins.csv`: Cleaned dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about penguins collected from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Features include:

- Species
- Island
- Bill length/depth
- Flipper length
- Body mass
- Sex

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize relationships between features
- Handle missing values and categorical data
- Train and evaluate a machine learning classifier to predict penguin species

##📜 License
