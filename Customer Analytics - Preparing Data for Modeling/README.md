# Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for customer segmentation using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The project is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development to classify or cluster customer data.

## 📁 Files

- `notebook.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing code for data analysis and model building.
- `customer_train.csv`: Dataset with customer features for training and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Models (e.g., KMeans, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Evaluation Metrics and Visualizations

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes customer-related attributes such as age, income, spending score, and more. It is used to segment customers either by classification labels or unsupervised clustering.

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Include model evaluation reports and metrics
- Add deployment options (e.g., Streamlit or Flask app)
- Integrate additional datasets
